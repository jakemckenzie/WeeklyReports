\noindent So for the first week and prior the work that has been done on the senior 
project was mostly by Jake. During the fall break Jake met with doctor 
Michael McCourt to talk over help the professor along with a research 
project of his. Currently the project is being designed to have stages with
a baseline being used to serve Mike's research. This project will have a user
feed input to a \href{http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/TurtleBot}{turtlebot (Burger)}.\\\\
This user will attempt to follow a path laid out for them. Mike has an equation
to smooth out noisy inputs which he would like to test and we have ideas
for how we might extend the project to be a better mechanism to test his equation.
Jake does not quite understand how that equation works or how it will interact with
the project but that's where we are currently at.\\\\
The current idea for the project is to split it into three stages with 
the possibility of stages being added in the future. The first stage of the
project will be to get the Turtlebot to be controlled by an Xbox controller.
The second stage will be to get the sensor for the turtlebot to talk to the sensors
we will place in a room. The last stage will be to get a webcam that is attached to
turtlebot to use OpenCV so that the user uses the camera to follow the path.\\\\
To test the robot we will need access to a large room that we are working on finding 
and getting access to on campus. That does not need to happen immediately but it will needed 
later on. A meeting was scheduled with Mike on Monday. At this meeting we discussed \\\\

the turtlebot to spin.}
